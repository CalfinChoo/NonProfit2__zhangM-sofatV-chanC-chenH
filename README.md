Roster:
* Clement Chan - SQL backend, Flask app/templates
* Hong Wei Chen - HTML, Flask app/templates
* Vishwaa Sofat - Project Manager
* Michael Zhang - Python scripts for searching the database, SQL backend

Instructions:

Please make sure that your device is able to run a Flask app. If you do not have flask installed, you can use the following Terminal commands:

``` 
$ pip3 install flask 
```

In the case that you can not use pip3 to install flask, you can crank up a virtual environment

``` 
$ python3 -m venv <name>
```

With this, you have created a virtual environment that you want to activate in the home directory.

```
$ . <name>/bin/active 
```
 
Now, you should be able to install flask using pip3.

``` 
$ pip3 install flask
```

You should now be able to run the Flask app within this virtual environment that you have created. 

To deactivate the environment:

``` 
$ deactivate 
```

To run our program, please make sure you are in the correct directory. Then:

``` 
$ python3 app.py 
```

Happy Bloggin'!
